Online bookstore database management involves organizing and controlling the data necessary for the operation of an online bookstore.
This includes managing information about books, authors, customers, orders, and inventory.
Here are the key components and functionalities involved in managing such a database:
1. Database Design (DDL - Data Definition Language):
   - Step 1: Identify and define the entities (tables) needed for the bookstore database. Examples include:
     - Books (ISBN, title, author, publisher, genre, price, etc.)
     - Customers (customer_id, name, address, email, etc.)
     - Orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, status, total_amount, etc.)
     - Order Details (order_id, ISBN, quantity, price)
     - Employees (employee_id, name, position, etc.)
     - Categories, Publishers, Reviews, etc.
2. Populating Data (DML - Data Manipulation Language):
   - Step 4: Insert sample data into the tables to populate them (`INSERT INTO` statements).
