Online bookstore database management involves organizing and controlling the data necessary for the operation of an online bookstore.
This includes managing information about books, authors, customers, orders, and inventory.
Here are the key components and functionalities involved in managing such a database:
1. Database Design (DDL - Data Definition Language):
   - Step 1: Identify and define the entities (tables) needed for the bookstore database. Examples include:
     - Books (ISBN, title, author, publisher, genre, price, etc.)
     - Customers (customer_id, name, address, email, etc.)
     - Orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, status, total_amount, etc.)
     - Order Details (order_id, ISBN, quantity, price)
     - Employees (employee_id, name, position, etc.)
     - Categories, Publishers, Reviews, etc.
2. Populating Data (DML - Data Manipulation Language):
   - Step 2: Insert sample data into the tables to populate them (`INSERT INTO` statements).
3. Querying Data (DQL - Data Query Language):
   - Step 3: Write SQL queries to retrieve information such as:
     - List of books by a specific author.
     - Total sales by month.
     - Customers who purchased more than a certain amount.
     - Best-selling books.
     - Pending orders.
     - etc.

4. Advanced Queries and Subqueries:
   - Step 4: Incorporate subqueries to solve complex queries. For example:
     - Find customers who have placed orders exceeding a certain total amount.
     - Identify books that have never been ordered.

5. Using Joins:
   - Step 6: Utilize different types of joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`) to combine data from multiple tables. For example:
     - Retrieve order details along with customer information.
     - List books along with their publishers.

6. Creating Views:
   - Step 7: Design and create views for commonly used queries. For instance:
     - Create a view to show all orders along with customer details.
     - Create a view for books that are currently in stock.

7. Testing and Optimization:
   - Step 8: Test the database queries and ensure they return accurate results.
   - Step 9: Optimize queries for better performance if necessary (indexing, query restructuring).
