SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. 
It is widely used in database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. 
SQL provides a way to interact with the database to perform various operations, including querying data, updating records, and managing database structures.

In this file you will find all the basic sql commands:

1.DDL (Data Defenition Language): is a subset of SQL used to define and manage database structures. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas.
    - CREATE
    - DROP
    - ALTER
    - TRUNCATE
2.DML(Data Manipulation Language): is a subset of SQL used for managing data within database objects.
    - INSERT
    - UPDATE
    - DELETE
3.DQL(Data Query Language): is a subset of SQL that is used to query the database and retrieve data from one or more tables.
    - SELECT
4.Constraints: in SQL are rules enforced on data columns in a table to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of the data. 
    - PRIMARY KEY
    - FOREIGN KEY
    - DEFAULT
    - UNIQUE
    - CHECK
    - NOT NULL
5.JOINS: Joins in SQL are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. 
   - INNER JOIN
   - LEFT JOIN
   - RIGHT JOIN
   - FULL JOIN
   - CROSS JOIN
   - LEFT ANTI JOIN
   - RIGHT ANTI JOIN
6. SUBQUERY: A subquery, also known as an inner query or nested query, is a query within another SQL query. 
    Subqueries can be used in various ways to perform more complex queries. 
    They can be nested inside SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements, or inside another subquery.
